USAGE                                       *neovim-scalavista-usage*

The install script symlinks a scalavista python3 script into usr/local/bin.
Execute it from the root of your project to launch a scalavista server.
You can use either a scalavista.json file (generated by the sbt-scalavista
plugin for sbt) or use it bare in which case external dependencies are
not recognized unless the jars reside in the ./lib folder. If you use the
-r flag, scalavista will recursively look into all subdirectories for
Scala source files. Use -d to enter debug mode. Once the server is 
running Neovim will connect to it upon opening any .scala file.
