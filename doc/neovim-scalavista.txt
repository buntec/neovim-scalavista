neovim-scalavista - Provides IDE-like features for Scala in Neovim.


SETUP                                       *neovim-scalavista-install*

An install script is provided in the root folder of this plugin. 

For an optimal auto-completion experience, we recommend

set completeopt=longest,menuone

USAGE                                       *neovim-scalavista-usage*

The install script symlinks the `scalavista` python3 script into `/usr/local/bin`. 
Execute it from the root of your project, ideally with a `scalavista.json` present. 
A scalavista server will be launched and Neovim will connect to it upon opening any Scala
source file in a buffer.

For an optimal experience use the [sbt-scalavista](https://github.com/buntec/sbt-scalavista) plugin 
to generate a `scalavista.json` file for your project. This is a simple json file with the following fields:

1. `classpath` (i.e., your dependencies)
1. `scalaBinaryVersion` (2.11 or 2.12)
1. `sources` - a list of your existing Scala source files (don't worry, newly creates files will be picked up on-the-fly)
1. `scalacOptions` - a list of scalac compiler options

You can use scalavista without a `scalavista.json` with the effect that external dependencies are 
not recognized and marked as errors in your code. The exception are manually managed dependencies in `./lib` which are
automatically appended to the classpath. You may want to use the `-r` flag to instruct scalavista to look into all
subdirectories for Scala source files and not just in the current directory (this has no effect in the presence of a
`scalavista.json`). 

Use `--help` to see a list of options.
